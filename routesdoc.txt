POST /availability {

    Requires: room, date

    Returns: JSON
    {
        times: [],
        message: ""
    }

    What to expect from times:
        The field times is an array filled with available start times represented in military time. By Default,
        times = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Any unavailbe times will be removed from the array
        before being returned. times = [7, 10, 14] means that only 7-7:59, 10-10:59, and 2-2:59 are available.

    What to expect from message: 
        1.) Message is an error (from mongoose), which might be a db connection issue.
        2.) Message is "Room has nothing reserved this day", which means either the room you passed in has no reservations, or it
            doesn't have any on the date you passed in, or the data you passed in could be wrong.
        3.) Message is "Success: Found 4 reservations on this date". Everything worked and 4 times should have been removed from
            the times array.
